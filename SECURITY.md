## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by contacting us at **security@example.com** (replace with your actual contact).

- I will acknowledge all reports within 48 hours.
- I aim to provide a fix or response within 14 days.
- Once a vulnerability is verified, I will coordinate disclosure timelines with the reporter.
- If the issue is declined (e.g., not reproducible or not a security risk), we will explain the reasons.
- Please do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until we have addressed them to avoid risks to users.
  - [You can safely report a vulnerability here privately](https://github.com/DefinetlyNotAI/PyCTools/security/advisories/new)

Thank you for helping us keep the project secure.
